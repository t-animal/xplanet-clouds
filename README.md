# xplanet-clouds

I use this repo to keep track of the earth and cloud images that I use to create my desktop wallpaper. Hence, it is quite big. Clone at your own risk.

If you are only interested in the cloud files, which you probably are, then try https://nightly.link/t-animal/xplanet-clouds/workflows/periodic-cloud-download/main/images which should update automatically every six hours from this repo's github actions' artifacts.
