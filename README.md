# xplanet-clouds

I use this repo to keep track of the earth and cloud images that I use to create my desktop wallpaper. Hence, it is quite big. Clone at your own risk.

Create a nifty image using `./scripts/combine-with-clouds.sh --download`.

If you are only interested in the stitched cloud files, then try https://t-animal.github.io/xplanet-clouds/ which should update automatically every six hours from this repo's github actions' artifacts.
